# Programming Language
___
**Note**: Due to some issues presented during the efforts of searching and enabling a functional environment to program in Ceylon, I've been allowed to change my programming language to the first available one, which is Gosu. Therefore, the following project is based on Gosu instead of Ceylon.
___

## Gosu 

### Sheet
- *Purpose*: its a general purpose language that can, also, serve as a scripting language, having free-form Program types (.gsp files) for scripting as well as statically verified Template files (.gst files).
- *Paradigm*: Object-Oriented
- *Weaknesses and Strenghts*:

	#### *Strenghts*
    - Easy to read syntax
    - Simplified object and variables usage
    - JSON support and dynamic typing
    - Transactions for database integrity
    - XML/XSD support
    - Web service (SOAP) support
    - Compatibility with existing Java libraries

	#### *Weakenesses*
	- It's development is frozen
	- It's not supported in many IDEs, is only available in IntelliJ 2021.1.3 version or older.
	- Lacks of key built-in functions, relies too much on java libraries.

- *Implementation*: As it's based on JVM, it's a compiled language
- *Runtime / Maquina Virtual*: Runs in a Java Virtual Machine
- *Supported Platforms*: Works in Linux, Mac and Windows
- *Key Users*: Guidewire Software, Inc.
- *History*: This language started by the hand of Guidewire Software in 2002 as a scripting language. It had to wait 8 years until its release as an Apache 2 licensed product. The latest version is 1.10, released in January 2016, along with a new IntelliJ IDEA editor plugin. 
Guidewire has decided to freeze the development of new Gosu programming language constructs at this time. However, they continue using and working on it with RESTful APIs and Integration Frameworks on Java.
- *State*: Dead
